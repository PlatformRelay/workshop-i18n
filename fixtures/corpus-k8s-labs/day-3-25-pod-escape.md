| **Section** | S25 — Security & pod escape |
| **Environment** | **kind-only · strictly defensive** (no shared-cluster path) |
| **Estimated time** | 30 min |

## Objective

See — in the safest possible way — how two Pod fields (`privileged` + `hostPath: /`) let a
container **escape onto its node**, then **block that exact Pod** with the `restricted` Pod
Security Standard from S17. You will:

1. Prove you're on a kind cluster with a **guard script** before touching anything offensive.
2. In a **permissive** namespace, run the escape Pod and read **one benign node file** to prove
   you're reading the **node's** filesystem — not the container image's.
3. **Delete** the Pod, label the namespace **`enforce=restricted`**, and **re-apply the same Pod**
   → watch **Pod Security Admission reject it at CREATE**, for the privileged/hostPath violations.
4. Apply the **hardened** manifest and confirm the same gate **admits** it.

The lab turns on one contrast: the settings that make an escape possible are **exactly** the ones
`restricted` forbids — and admission blocks them **before the Pod ever exists**.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker + `kind` + `kubectl`**, and rights to create a local cluster. You will create a
  disposable cluster named `escape-lab` and delete it at the end.
- **No shared-cluster path exists for this lab.** The offensive step reads the node filesystem;
  that is only acceptable on a cluster you own. If you can't run kind, **read along** — every step
  has a spoiler with the exact output.
- Internet pull access for `alpine:3.20` (a tiny image with a shell — used for *both* the escape
  Pod and the hardened Pod, so the only thing that changes is the security settings).
- Pod Security Admission is **built into the API server** (stable since v1.25) — nothing to install.

## Files used

- `context-check.sh` — refuses to proceed unless the current target is the exact, locally owned
  disposable kind cluster. This is
  the workshop's shared safety guard, kept byte-identical to the tested canonical
  [`infra/context-guard.sh`](../../infra/context-guard.sh).
- `pod-escape.yaml` — the `privileged` + `hostPath: /` Pod. **Dangerous by design.**
- `pod-hardened.yaml` — the same workload, hardened to satisfy `restricted` → admitted.

Everything the lab creates is labelled `app: s25` so cleanup is a single selector — and the whole
cluster is disposable anyway.

## Guided task

Work through the steps without opening the companion unless you are blocked. The spoiler
contains exact commands, expected state, explanations, and recovery guidance.

[Spoiler: guided solutions and expected output](./25-pod-escape.solution.md#guided-solutions)

### Step 0 — a throwaway cluster, and the guard that gates everything

```bash
export WORKSHOP_CLUSTER_NAME=escape-lab
kind create cluster --name "$WORKSHOP_CLUSTER_NAME"
```

Now write the guard. Its `--claim` mode can establish the ownership marker on an existing disposable
cluster, but only **after** the exact context, loopback API endpoint, local kind provider, and node
metadata have all passed. The endpoint must equal the server in kind's own generated kubeconfig.
Every later offensive step runs the stricter read-only check in the `escape` namespace.

```bash
cat > context-check.sh <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Fail closed unless this is the exact, locally owned disposable kind cluster.

**Task:** confirm the guard passes on your kind cluster — and understand it would **fail closed**
anywhere else.

> **⚠️ Why this guard matters.** The next step deliberately reads the node's filesystem. That's a
> teaching move in a cluster you'll throw away; it's a **security incident** on a shared cluster.
> The context check is the single safety rail that keeps the offensive step where it belongs.
> Never remove it, and never widen it to match a real cluster's context name.

---

### Step 1 — the permissive namespace (the door is open)

`restricted` is opt-in. To *show* the escape first, we explicitly mark this namespace as the
loosest standard, `privileged` — so the API server won't stop the dangerous Pod.

```bash
./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }

kubectl label --overwrite namespace "$NS" \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged
kubectl get namespace "$NS" -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' | tr ',' '\n' | grep pod-security
```

**Task:** confirm the namespace enforces the `privileged` standard (i.e. no restrictions).

> **⚠️ Why this is dangerous in the real world.** A namespace with **no** enforced Pod Security
> Standard is the default on many clusters. It means *any* Pod anyone can create — including one
> with `privileged` + `hostPath` — is accepted. The very first hardening step on any cluster is to
> stop leaving namespaces unlabelled.

---

### Step 2 — the escape: read the node's filesystem from a Pod

Run the guard, then apply the escape Pod.

```bash
./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }

cat > pod-escape.yaml <<'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: escape
  labels: { app: s25 }
spec:
  containers:
    - name: shell
      image: alpine:3.20
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      securityContext:
        privileged: true                 # near-total power on the node
      volumeMounts:
        - name: host
          mountPath: /host               # the node's / is now visible at /host
  volumes:
    - name: host
      hostPath:
        path: /                          # mount the ENTIRE host root
EOF

kubectl apply -f pod-escape.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod/escape --timeout=60s
```

**Task:** prove you're reading the **node's** filesystem — not the alpine image's — with **one
benign read**. Compare the container's own `/etc/os-release` with the node's at `/host/etc/os-release`.

```bash
./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }

echo "== container image OS =="
kubectl exec escape -- cat /etc/os-release | grep -E '^(NAME|PRETTY_NAME)='

echo "== NODE OS (via the hostPath mount) =="
kubectl exec escape -- cat /host/etc/os-release | grep -E '^(NAME|PRETTY_NAME)='

echo "== node's kubernetes dir is right there (listing only — we read nothing sensitive) =="
kubectl exec escape -- ls /host/etc/kubernetes 2>/dev/null || \
  kubectl exec escape -- ls /host/etc | head
```

> **⚠️ Why this is the whole ballgame.** With `/host` = the node's `/`, this same *read-write*
> access reaches, on a real cluster: the **kubelet's client certificate and the cluster CA**
> (`/host/etc/kubernetes/pki`), **every Pod's projected ServiceAccount tokens and Secrets** under
> `/host/var/lib/kubelet/pods/…`, and the **static-pod directory** `/host/etc/kubernetes/manifests`
> — write a manifest there and the kubelet runs it **as root on the node**. `privileged` piles on
> device access and a relaxed seccomp profile. We demonstrate the *access* with one harmless read
> and stop; **do not** read tokens or write anything. The point is made — now we block it.

**Question:** we only ran `sleep` and one `cat`. Which **single setting** most enabled this escape?

> **⚠️ Why this is dangerous.** A single innocuous-looking `hostPath` line — no `privileged`
> needed — can silently hand a Pod the node's whole disk. It's why `hostPath` is treated as a
> `baseline`/`restricted` violation on its own: the volume type *is* the risk, regardless of what
> the container does with it.

---

### Step 3 — the fix: delete first, then let `restricted` reject the same Pod

**Order matters.** Pod Security Admission gates Pods at **CREATE** time only. Labelling the
namespace `restricted` does **not** evict the already-running escape Pod — so we **delete it
first**, then tighten the namespace, then try to re-create the *identical* Pod and watch admission
refuse it.

```bash
./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }

# 1) remove the running escape Pod (admission won't touch what already exists)
kubectl delete -f pod-escape.yaml

# 2) tighten the SAME namespace to the restricted standard
kubectl label --overwrite namespace "$NS" \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=restricted

# 3) re-apply the EXACT SAME escape manifest
kubectl apply -f pod-escape.yaml
```

**Task:** the re-apply is **rejected**. Read the error — is the Pod created, and which dangerous
settings are named?

```bash
kubectl get pod escape        # is it there?
```

> **⚠️ Why delete-then-relabel (and not relabel-first).** PSA is an **admission** controller — it
> only runs when an object is **created or updated**, never on objects already stored. If you label
> the namespace `restricted` while the escape Pod is running, the Pod **keeps running** — the
> policy doesn't retroactively kill it. That's a real operational gotcha: enforcing `restricted`
> protects you from *new* violating Pods but doesn't remediate existing ones. So we delete first,
> then prove the gate blocks the re-create.

**Question:** the escape Pod named **`privileged`** and **`hostPath`**, yet the error *also* lists
`runAsNonRoot`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation`, `capabilities`, and `seccompProfile`. Why all six?

> **⚠️ Why this matters for defence.** The escape settings (`privileged`, `hostPath`) and the
> least-privilege settings are enforced by the **same** namespace label. You don't choose between
> "block escapes" and "least privilege" — `restricted` gives you both, and a Pod that skips the
> least-privilege fields is treated as just as suspect as one that mounts the host.

---

### Step 4 — the hardened Pod the gate admits

Same workload (alpine running `sleep`), stripped of the escape levers and hardened to satisfy
`restricted`. `alpine` runs happily at **any** UID, so `runAsUser: 1000` won't CrashLoop the way a
root-only image would (the S17 landmine).

```bash
./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }

cat > pod-hardened.yaml <<'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hardened
  labels: { app: s25 }
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000                      # explicit non-root UID (alpine runs at any UID)
    seccompProfile: { type: RuntimeDefault }
  containers:
    - name: shell
      image: alpine:3.20
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      securityContext:
        allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
        capabilities: { drop: ["ALL"] }
      # no privileged, no hostPath — the escape levers are gone
EOF

kubectl apply -f pod-hardened.yaml
kubectl get pod hardened -w        # Ctrl-C once it's Running
```

**Task:** confirm the hardened Pod is **admitted and running**, and that it is genuinely non-root
with no view of the host.

```bash
kubectl exec hardened -- id
kubectl exec hardened -- ls /host 2>&1 || true
```

> **⚠️ Why `runAsUser: 1000` here.** `runAsNonRoot: true` is a *promise the image must keep* (the
> S17 landmine): admission only checks the field, but the **kubelet** refuses to start a container
> whose image resolves to UID 0. A root-only image would admit and then **CrashLoop** with
> `container has runAsNonRoot and image will run as root`. `alpine` runs at **any** UID, so pinning
> `runAsUser: 1000` guarantees a non-root user the image actually supports.

**Question:** across the whole lab — which **single defence** was highest-leverage?

> **⚠️ Why "highest-leverage" is the point.** Runtime detection catches an escape *after* it
> happens; image scanning catches a *known* CVE. Admission (`restricted`) is the only layer that
> stops the dangerous Pod from **ever existing** — it's proactive, needs no agent, and covers Pods
> you haven't even written yet. That's why it's the first thing to turn on, not the last.

## Observe

- A container is a **process on the node's kernel**: `hostPath: /` handed the Pod the **node's**
  filesystem (proved by the Debian-vs-Alpine `os-release` diff), and `privileged` handed it
  near-total power. The escape needed **no exploit** — just two supported Pod fields.
- **Admission gates CREATE, not existing Pods:** labelling `restricted` didn't evict the running
  escape Pod — you had to **delete first**, which is exactly why the fix order is delete → relabel
  → re-apply.
- The **exact same manifest** that ran under `enforce: privileged` is **rejected** under
  `enforce: restricted` — the error names **`privileged`** and **`hostPath`** plus the four S17
  least-privilege gates (six rules), and the Pod is **never created**.
- The **hardened** Pod — same workload, escape levers removed, `restricted`-compliant — is
  **admitted** and runs as **uid 1000** with no `/host`.
- **Highest-leverage defence:** `enforce: restricted` on the namespace, at admission. Everything
  else is defence in depth around it.

## Challenge

On the disposable kind cluster only, prove that labelling a namespace restricted does
not evict an already-running privileged hostPath Pod. Capture the order delete → enforce →
re-apply, and show the same escape manifest is rejected afterward.

**Difficulty:** Advanced

**Success criteria:** Show the escape Pod status remains Running after enforce=restricted is applied, delete
that Pod, re-apply the escape manifest, and prove admission rejects it (error output names
privileged/hostPath) while a hardened Pod reaches Running.

**Hints:** Stay inside the context-check.sh guard; use kubectl get pod -w around the label
change; compare the restricted violation list to privileged and hostPath.

[Spoiler: challenge solution](./25-pod-escape.solution.md#challenge-solution)

## Verify

Confirm kind-only escape lab evidence before cleanup.

```bash
./context-check.sh
kubectl get pod -n "$NS" -l app=s25
kubectl get namespace "$NS" --show-labels | tr ',' '\n' | grep pod-security || true
```

Expected: hardened Pod evidence and/or admission rejection context remain until you burn the
disposable cluster.

## Cleanup / reset

```bash
# scoped cleanup — everything this lab made is labelled app=s25
./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }
kubectl delete pod -l app=s25 -n "$NS" --ignore-not-found

./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }
# panic reset: remove the lab Namespace via your cluster UI / burn kind — do not use an unqualified ns delete here

# PANIC RESET (recommended) — the cluster was disposable; throw the whole thing away:
./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }
kind delete cluster --name "$WORKSHOP_CLUSTER_NAME"

# Remove the guard only after every destructive command it protects is finished.
rm -f context-check.sh pod-escape.yaml pod-hardened.yaml
```

> **Panic option: delete the cluster.** Because the escape Pod had the host root mounted read-write,
> the cleanest guarantee that nothing was left behind is to **destroy the kind cluster entirely** —
> `kind delete cluster --name escape-lab`. It was disposable by design. This is the reset to reach
> for if anything felt off, and it's why this lab is kind-only: you can always burn it down.

## Stretch (optional) — soft-launch with `warn` before you `enforce`

On a real cluster you don't flip `enforce=restricted` on a busy namespace blind — you turn on
**`warn`** first to discover what *would* break, fix it, then enforce. Prove the difference against
the escape Pod on a fresh scratch namespace.

```bash
./context-check.sh || { echo "guard failed — stopping"; exit 1; }
kubectl create namespace s25-warn
kubectl label namespace s25-warn pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=restricted
kubectl apply -n s25-warn -f pod-escape.yaml
kubectl get pod escape -n s25-warn
```

> **⚠️ Why the stretch stays kind-only too.** `warn` **creates** the Pod — so this scratch namespace
> briefly runs a privileged, host-mounting Pod exactly like Step 2. That's fine in your disposable
> kind cluster and nowhere else. Delete the namespace when done, or just `kind delete cluster`.
